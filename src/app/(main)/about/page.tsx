                <p className="mb-4">
                  StatePulse was created by Kairui Cheng as a personal project to help him understand the complexities of state and local legislation. Curious about how laws are made and how they affect everyday life, Kairui set out to build a platform that would make it easier for anyone to access and understand legislative information.

                <p className="mb-4">
                  The platform is designed to empower citizens by providing them with the tools they need to stay informed about the laws that govern their communities.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  Kairui is a current freshman at the University of Washington - Seattle, majoring in Computer Science. In his free time, Kairui enjoys reading science fiction, coding, hiking Washington trails, running, and practicing the Alto Saxophone.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Why StatePulse Matters</h2>
              <p className="mb-4">
                State and local governments make thousands of decisions every year that directly impact your life - from education funding and healthcare policies to transportation infrastructure and environmental regulations. Yet most citizens remain unaware of these crucial decisions until it's too late to influence them.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                StatePulse changes that by providing real-time access to legislative information, breaking down barriers to civic engagement, and empowering citizens to participate meaningfully in the democratic process.
